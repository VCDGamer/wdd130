    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Victory Chinedu Duru</h2>
    <h2>VCD</h2>
    <p>I am Victory Duru, a 20-year old Nigerian. I live at Ogun state but ws born and raised in Lagos.</p>
    <p>I am also a solo game developer. My hobbies are playing video games and drawing/animating. I love finding new ways to bring the two together as one. I also learn how to make music.</p>
    <p>I took this course because I believe it would help boost my programming skills and also serve as a source of income while I work as a game developer.</p>
    <p>The thing I love the most about BYU-Idaho is how we get the opportunity to learn skills from some of the best teachers ever while being able to make time for other main priorities. Plus, learning here had been reaaly fun.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church for 5 years and I am currently serving as the assistant clerk in my ward. One of my favorite scriptures is 1 Corinthians 16:13 which reads: "Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong." </p>

    <p>p.s I'm sorry I could not upload any actual image of myself. I have camera shyness and thanks to that, I don't have any photo of myself at the time.</p>
    <p>If it is still very important to have my photo in this about me page, I'll get some photos as soon as possible.</p>
